# Antimony
a real-time stream processeing and distributed computation system written completely in Rust designed to out-storm storm and is heavily influence by Twitter Heron.


## Why Antimony?

* ### Speed, performance and safety

  Antimony was developed completly in rust to benift from the zero overhead princple of rust allowing us to write high perforemance systems code with memory safty as an added benift.

* ### Scalability and Relaibility

  Antimony address all the architectural and efficiency issues of storm just like Heron does however implemented in a much safer language.

* ### Idiomatic Rust

  Everything is written in Rust, even upload tools and not a single jvm insight.

* ### Easy devlopment and troubleshooting

  Antimony uses a very familiar API to Apache Storm and Heron, and very similar concepts.

* ### Straightforward and responsive UI

  Antimony offers a simple UI to manage\/monitor\/debug topolgies with ability to see both logical and physical representaion of each topology as well as metrics for each component of every topology.
